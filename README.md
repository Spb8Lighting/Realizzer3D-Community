## Convert Lux@Xm to Lux @Ym

To convert a Lux value @ X m to a Lux value @ Y m one, you can convert it into Candela (unit without any distance) to convert it back to Lux with m value.

From https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/light/lux-to-candela-calculator.html set your input Lux @ X ft/m value to get the Candela

Then from https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/light/candela-to-lux-calculator.html set your Candela value and set the awaited distance for Lux value (5m for Realizzer 3D)
